\# Folio – Markdown Image Renderer



\*Turn markdown into styled, publication-ready image cards. Auto-splits long content. Client-side. No servers.\*

\## The Name



\*\*Folio\*\* is a leaf of a manuscript or book—a discrete, numbered page (recto and verso) that holds written text. In scribal tradition, a folio is the fundamental unit of the physical archive: a bounded surface that preserves structure, enforces legibility, and demands careful composition.



This tool transforms your continuous markdown stream into a bound set of folios (image cards). It restores the discipline of the page to the fluidity of digital text—each card is a clean, styled surface ready for presentation, archive, or distribution.

\## What It Does



\*\*Folio\*\* renders markdown as high‑quality JPEG images. Paste your text, choose a theme and styling mode, and export. If your content exceeds the defined height limit, it is automatically split across multiple pages (folios)—preserving headers, lists, tables, and structural context—so nothing is cropped or lost.



Everything runs in your browser. No uploads, no API keys, no server dependencies.

\## Why You Would Use This



| Problem | Solution |

| :--- | :--- |

| Design tools (Canva, Photoshop) are slow and inconsistent. | One click from markdown to styled pages. |

| Long text gets cropped or truncated by image generators. | Auto‑splitting preserves all content across multiple cards. |

| Team members use different editors and formatting. | Single markdown source produces consistent, branded output. |

| Screenshots look unprofessional and lack typographic control. | Themed, colour‑coded renders with bracket semantics and math support. |

| Sharing raw LLM outputs (tables, code, nested lists) is messy. | Render AI‑generated markdown directly as structured visual assets. |

\## Key Features



| Feature | Description |

| :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Full markdown support\*\* | Headers, lists, tables, blockquotes, code blocks, LaTeX math. |

| \*\*7 colour themes\*\* | Orange, Matrix, Cyber, Nord, Dracula, Solar, Crimson. |

| \*\*5 semantic styling modes\*\* | Standard, Alchemist (polarity), Codex (manuscript), Desert (warm/minimal), Legal (case‑file). |

| \*\*Auto‑splitting\*\* | Breaks content across multiple pages; preserves headers and list context. |

| \*\*Linguistic root detection\*\* | Auto‑highlights 3‑letter patterns (e.g., `q-r-a`) as semantic units. |

| \*\*Math rendering\*\* | Inline (`$...$`) and block (`$$...$$`) LaTeX via KaTeX. |

| \*\*Adjustable dimensions\*\* | Card width (400–1200px), max height (400–3000px). |

| \*\*Resolution multiplier\*\* | 1.0× to 3.4× for high‑DPI exports. |

| \*\*Batch download\*\* | One click to download all generated pages in sequence. |

| Inline math (`$...$`) | ✅ | KaTeX rendering. |

| Display math (`$$...$$`) | ✅ | Block‑level equations. |

| `->` and `=>` | ✅ | Rendered as drift (⟶) and logic (⟹) vectors. |

| 3‑letter roots (e.g., `q-r-a`) | ✅ | Auto‑detected and wrapped as irreducible units. |

\## How to Use



1\. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

2\. Paste your markdown text into the text area.

3\. Select a \*\*theme\*\* and \*\*semantic mode\*\*.

4\. Adjust card \*\*width\*\*, \*\*max height\*\*, and \*\*resolution\*\* using the sliders.

5\. Click \*\*Render Images\*\* (or press `Ctrl+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter`).

6\. Preview each card and download them individually, or click \*\*Download All Images\*\*.

\## Configuration Options



| Control | Range / Options | Effect |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Card Width\*\* | 400–1200 px | Horizontal canvas size; affects font scaling and layout density. |

| \*\*Max Height\*\* | 400–3000 px | Vertical threshold that triggers page splits. |

| \*\*Resolution Multiplier\*\* | 1.0× – 3.4× | Scales final image for high‑DPI export (e.g., 2.0× for retina). |

| \*\*Full Artifacts / Cap Length\*\* | Toggle | \*Off\* = aggressive splitting (word‑by‑word for long paragraphs). \*On\* = preserves larger blocks with less fragmentation. |
